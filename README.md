# Colony-Infestation
Colony Infestation is a short top-down shooter game that I created in my Game Development 2 class.
The story is about the player crash landing on Mars and must figuer out what happened to the Mars Colony.
The game has multiple objectives to complete which is displayed in the top right of the player's screen.
There is also a Health System and enemys that attack and follow the player.

If you wish to run the code properly you must have Unity version 2019.4.5f1
